/**
 * Uses the Binomial Distribution to find the expected probability of seeing
 * the phrase. This is done by estimating the probability of observing the
 * number of occurrences of the second word in the bigram preceded by the first
 * word, out of the number of occurrences of the second word alone.
 * 
 * We then calculate the mean and standard deviation of the Binomial distribution.
 * Since the Binomial Distribution can approximates a Normal Distribution in
 * certain cases, we assume that we can do this, and calculate the z-score for
 * the observed probability (which gives us how far it is from the mean in units
 * of standard deviation). The z-score is returned by the phrase filter, and
 * it is compared to a given confidence interval in the client.
