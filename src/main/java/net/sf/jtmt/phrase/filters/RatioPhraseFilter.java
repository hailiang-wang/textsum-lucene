/**
 * Uses the ratio of estimated (via Binomial distribution) probability versus
 * the actual observed occurrence probability to find whether a sequence of
 * words should be considered as a phrase.
 * 
 * Using a Binomial Distribution, we try to estimate the probability of
 * observing the number of occurrences of the second word in the bigram preceded
 * by the first word, out of the number of occurrences of the second word alone.
 * 
 * This is then compared to the observed probability of the phrase in the
 * document corpus. If the ratio is above a threshold, then it is considered
 * to be a phrase.
